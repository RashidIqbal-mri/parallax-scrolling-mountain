                Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.<br/><br/>
                Front-end development is about creating the perfect marriage between form and function.<br/><br/>
                A good front-end developer is always learning and always experimenting with new techniques and technologies.<br/><br/>
                In the end, the front-end code is what the user interacts with, so it's important to make it as seamless and delightful as possible.
